.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,

\fBgnome-mplayer\fP is a simple GUI for MPlayer. It is based 
heavily on the mplayerplug-in source code and can basically be seen as a 
standalone version of that. GNOME MPlayer is currently changing alot. 
However, it is good enough that I can use it as my default viewer for 
media on my personal machine
